# Trello Date Digger

Pull in all the cards on the Commissioned list on the Trello Proposal Board
Find the oldest action date on a card, also find out if there is an action for moving the card to the board. That typically represents when it went from an idea to greenlit for a proposal.  It also writes the number of board moves found. If the number is not 0 or 1 it will require manual digging to determine how long it's been a proposal.
